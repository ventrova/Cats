    <p> I hope you enjoyed my favorite video on cats.We all know cats for having 9 lives, purring when you rub them, their mischevious behavior, hairballs, and their encounters with dogs.
        Today we'll explore cat origins and provide you with cool facts that you probably did not know of.</p>
        <br>
    <h2> Origins </h2>
    <p> The Near Eastern wildcat still roams the deserts of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries. (See map.) Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats.
"It's plausible that the ancient [domestic cat] lineages were present in the wildcat populations back as far as 70,000 or 100,000 years ago," said study co-author Stephen O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland.
The wildcats may have been captured around 10,000 or 12,000 years ago when humans were settling down to farming, he added
    <h2> Facts</a></h2>
        <ol type ="A">
            <li>

            <li>Rather than nine months, cats' pregnancies last about nine weeks.</li>
            <li>Eating grass rids a cats' system of any fur and helps with digestion.</li>
